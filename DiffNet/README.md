# Differential Network Analysis

The aim of the method is to compare two different networks based on cell-cell interactions, to find which interactions changes due to a condition. It is based on the cell-cell interaction output produced by CellPhoneDB anlyses.  

The analysis is preferably run on a cluster due to computational time.

There should be two input files, one per condition, whith the structure as in; HA_expression_matrix_AllergenChallenged_3D.txt in/example_data/test_counts.txt. The code relies on a certain folder structure, se Differential_Network_analysis.py for details.
